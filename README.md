# Part 1 & 2
- This challenge was to make an interactive map that showed locations of earthquakes while indicating their intensity and depth by styling the markers. D3 was used to fetch earthquake data from the USGS website and the appropriate data were collected and stored into lists. Then those lists were looped through to create markers each earthquake on the map. The latitude and longitude were used to place each location. Place, magnitude, and depth were used to create pop-up information for each marker. A map layer was created using leaflet and openstreetmap.org and the map was created. I just added part 2 in as an extra layer. Using the geoJSON file from the link provided, the borders of the techtonic plates were added into the map to show the relation to earthquake location. They can be switched on and off. Finally a legend was added to show the color scale for indicating depth.
